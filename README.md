# Gene-Expression
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a model that predicts if certain genes are cancerous or not.

## Dataset Overview
Name: gene_expression

Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

Size: [33,036 bytes]

Independent Columns: [Gene One, Gene Two]

Dependent Columns: [Cancer Present] 

## Skills Demonstrated
* Feature Analysis
* Data profiling, Standardization, Normalization, 
* Models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine(svm), Naives Bayes
* Model training, testing and predicting
* Accuracy_score, Confusion Matrix
* Visualization, merging, joining using pandas and matplot libraries

## Insight
1. Several classification models were used to get the best

2. The k value was as high as 8. 

4. The svm model was the best having an accuracy score of 94.53%
